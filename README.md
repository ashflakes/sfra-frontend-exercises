Exercise 3 - final version

The text of the exercise was a bit confusing to me, so i refactored it multiple times. Had an asset with the image in the body of the content, then i saw the items mentioned in the hints section, and i decided to edit the system object for content, add a new attribute and import the image src and name from there.
